    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1¼ cup brown sugar light or dark</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg + 2 egg yolks room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup semi sweet chocolate chunks</li>
        <li>Sea Salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together plain flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>To a pan over medium heat, add the butter. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes until it starts to bubble and then brown. Make sure not to cook it any further or it can burn. Transfer it to a bowl and allow it to cool so it's not hot.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the brown sugar and white sugar. Pour in the butter and mix just until combined. Then add the egg and egg yolks and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>Add the dry to the wet and fold in using a rubber spatula until a cookie dough forms.</li>
            <li>Mix in the milk chocolate and dark chocolate and let the dough rest for 1 hour or until your ready to bake.</li>
            <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Scoop out portions of the dough about the size of 1/4 to 1/3 measuring cup. Make sure to space them apart, 6 cookies per sheet.</li>
            <li>Pop in the oven to bake for about 10 - 13 minutes (13 mins rec)  until the edges are golden brown and the center is still a bit soft. The cookies will continue baking out of the oven on the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Leave them on the pan for about 10 minutes or until firm before transferring them to a cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
            <li>Optional but sprinkle a little bit of sea salt over each cookie to further bring out the sweetness of the chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
